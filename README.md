## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The focus for this project was to make a clean, elegant website that matched the makeup artist's brand. I designed the website to be inviting to all potential clients. Also included a small contact me form to send to the makeup artists email.

## Optimizations

The client is happy with the site. However, if I had to make changes, I would create a blog section and more built out pages to promote SEO to bring in more clients.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how buttons can be clicked in order to move throughout the page! Even though it's small, the ability for users to click the contact me form at the beginning of the page will bring in more clients rather than hiding the contact me section at the very bottom. Ease of use for users is everything.
